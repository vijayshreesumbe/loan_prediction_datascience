# loan_prediction_datascience
This project uses machine learning to predict loan approval based on applicant data like gender, marital status, income, and credit history. We'll explore and preprocess the data, experiment with classification algorithms, and evaluate model performance. Our goal is to automate loan approval, improving decision-making for financial institutions.
